# Genetic Algorithm Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a genetic algorithm (GA). Genetic algorithms are a type of optimization algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection. This implementation can be used to solve various optimization problems. Tried to minimise the use of loops by using inbuilt matrix operations, especially in the various selection methods.
Ensured the code was refactored to functions. 

## Features
- **Population Initialization:** Random generation of initial population.
- **Fitness Function:** Customizable function to evaluate the fitness of each individual.
- **Selection:** Methods like roulette wheel, tournament selection, etc., for selecting individuals for reproduction.
- **Crossover:** Functionality for combining two parents to create offspring.
- **Mutation:** Random alterations to maintain genetic diversity.
- **Termination:** Criteria to stop the algorithm after a certain number of generations or when a satisfactory solution is found.
